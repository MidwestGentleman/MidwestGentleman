- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m DHuts. I, like a lot of us in Web 3 am a polymath, which is made possible by my passion for technology, my pursuit to make everything more efficient, and my unquenchable desire to learn everything about everything I find "cool" 

- ðŸ‘€ For most of my career I've been a Technical Business Consultant by day and a hobbiest by night, which has given me the opportunity to work on so many team and learn so many systems and technologies. I have direct experience working a role in every facet of the SDLC. I have over 10 years experience as a developer and have developed in over 10 programming languages as a developer/analyst, however I am currently working as a Sr. Technical Product Manager for a BigData Company. Iâ€™m interested in Web 3, Automation, Data Science (ML/AI), Algo Trading, Financial Analytics, Financial Modeling, and Blockchain Education.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m obsessed with all things crypto and have been for a while... I remember back in 2014 watching BTC fall from $1000+ to sub $200, and then also not touching it again until 2017 lol. I'm now fully sold on Web3 and have been getting more and more invloved in an attempt to transition full time. Unfortunelty most of my portfolio belongs to my clients, so i've been building out my dev portfolio with NFT projects on ETH and SOL and working with projects in the space. While I mostly build on the backend, I have some experience working with customer usability and human driven design, and am actively working to master React to display the utilities I build for the space.
